    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Growing up, I was always an avid reader, and it's something I've been working hard to prioritize
        in my life again. It always brings me a sense of calm which is matched by nothing else, and allows
        me to entirely escape into completely different realms, which is particularly the case for my 
        preferred genre of fantasy. I recently got a kindle, and have been enjoying the built in 
        tracker which tells me which days I read, but that data is rather limited so while it wasn't quite
        suitable for what I wanted in reading data, it served as excellent inspiration.
    </p><p>
        Furthermore, I wanted the physicalization to be something pretty I could put in my room, perhaps 
        something that could serve as additional ambiance for the perfect cozy reading session. Ultimately,
        I came up with a backlit stained glass design with a curtain that would reveal only as much of the 
        design as how close I am to my reading goal for the week (Which also serves as extra motivation to
        hit the goal, and even surpass it early in the week to enjoy the design). The stained glass design
        is the rose from Beauty and the Beast; I chose this because it's pretty, but also because I'm a
        disney kid and there's nothing more perfect for this than a nod to a story about a girl who loves reading.
        Currently, I have the reading goal set to 20 minutes a day * 7 days a week, so 140 minutes a week.

        <p>The construction; I sewed the curtain, and many holes were drilled/dremmeled out of 
          the box to support the wiring and motor. Brackets for the motor were cut from a cd case!

        <p>Putting it all together; The axle was just small enough to be shoved onto the end of the motor but maintain enough
          friction to spin, and I taped the curtain to the axle. I added a wire hanger and taped some
          pennies to the bottom of the curtain to weigh it down and keep it straight. The lights were fairy lights I 
          cut the end off of and soldered to breadboard wire!</p>
