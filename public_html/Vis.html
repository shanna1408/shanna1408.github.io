    <h1>Towards Glanceable On-Demand AR Conversation Visualization</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">
            This poster is a work in progress of a greater research project for which we
            seek to answer the following two questions:
            Our guiding research questions are as follows:
            <br><i>
            1. How do different platforms (glanceable AR, non-AR mobile, and non-AR desktop) impact the social dynamics and visual presentation of real-time conversation analysis and data interpretation, and how do these factors shape user interaction with the information?
            <br>
            2. What types of data analysis and visual encodings of userâ€™s real-time conversation data generally provide the most value?

        <p  style="text-align: left;">
            This project explores how glanceable, real-time conversation timelines can 
            enhance discussions in Augmented Reality (AR) while remaining lightweight 
            and non-intrusive. AR is increasingly being used for conversational support, 
            but most existing approaches focus on persistent or highly interactive 
            visualizations. Instead, I wanted to design a system that augments 
            conversations without distracting from them, allowing users to quickly glance 
            at topic summaries and dismiss them as needed. Using Large Language Models 
            (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), I developed a method to 
            recognize and classify topic shifts in real time. For visualization, I used 
            XReal smart glasses, which offer an unobtrusive, everyday wearable AR 
            experience. This work identifies key challenges and opportunities in 
            minimalist AR conversation visualization, and through prototyping and testing, 
            I reflect on different design techniques to make AR-enhanced conversations 
            more seamless and intuitive.
