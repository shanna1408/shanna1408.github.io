        <p>
            This photography website is part of a databases class project that runs on local host. It features
            a working 'sign up' and 'log in' system for clients, and 'log in' only for admins. Admins are 
            able to add photos to their own gallery and add available times for client booking. Clients 
            are able to view each photographer's gallery, book photographers during available times (if any),
            view existing appointments and session photos, and contact the photographer.
