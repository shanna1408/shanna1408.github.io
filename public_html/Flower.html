        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is the story of a little flower who, after being tucked away under a desk for the night, is wilted and sun deprived when it notices the room lighting up. It raises its little head, and looks around for the source, before settling on the window. It runs to make it onto the windowsill and bask in the full rays of the sun, but not without some challenges. Finally, with some clever use of its surroundings, it makes it to its destination and stretches out in glee.

            I modeled the flowerpot in blender, directed, posed and filmed this animation. This was completed as
            a study of Disney's 12 Principles of Animation.
            Eventually, I would like to go back and re-render this in high resolution (cycling render)! There was insufficient time
            for this when it was created, unfortunately. But I am still very happy with how it turned out.
