    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This corset is designed to be a visual representation of the key emotional contexts of
        a person's conversations throughout the day. I handsewed the corset and soldered all connections. As you or someone around you speaks, the 
        speech is recorded and sent to a sentiment analyzer from hugging face to determine the
        emotion in the speech snippet. This sentiment analyzer had over 50 recognizable emotions,
        which I mapped down to 7, shown below. The lights are then assigned to a ratio of the recognized
        emotions, which are evenly dispersed throughout the garment. For example, if 'joy'(yellow) 
        was recognized twice and 'anger'(red) was recognized once, then 66% of the lights would be
        yellow and 33% would be red. Neutral statements are ignored. The key is as follows:
        <br><br>
        Joy: Golden
        <br>
        Anger: Red
        <br>
        Sadness: DeepSkyBlue
        <br>
        Love: Hot Pink
        <br>
        Fun: Green
        <br>
        Unease: DarkOliveGreen
        <br>
        Reflection: Violet

        <p>I had to solder each light strip together. There were 7 dual ended light strips with 3 connections (power, data line, ground). So it was a lot of effort! After soldering each connection, I secured it with heat shrink.
