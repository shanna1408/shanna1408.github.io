            FluencyAR is an augmented reality second language learning tool centered around the concepts of language immersion and self-talk. For many second language learners, advancing into upper levels of fluency can be difficult without sufficient opportunities to practice. Traditional solutions of tutoring or finding exchange partners are often inconvenient or limiting. FluencyAR provides situational conversation practice in highly self-directed practice sessions that imitate environments where the target language is dominant. We utilize augmented reality to allow users to practice their target language with immediate feedback at any time, and from any location. Using ChatGPT and the physical space of the user, we can produce unique and challenging conversation prompts relative to a user’s surroundings, ensuring that sessions remain interesting.
