    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p >Throughout history, since the first humans, we have moved expressively in time to music. But what if the music moved to us? And there, 
      the Robot Jacket was born. Admittedly, the sound emitted by the Robot Jacket could only be called music in the loosest sense 
      of the word. However, the robotic sounding output as opposed to more traditional compositional melodies allow for a sound 
      output that sounds relatively harmonious no matter what the movement is. To pick more traditional melodic sounds to more directly 
      emulate an 'instrument' would mean that only a practiced performer could make 'good' sound, as the noises would be likely to 
      sound bad together if one were to just move and dance randomly. This would defeat the purpose; the idea is to move freely and 
      joyously let the sound match you, without needing to worry about skill (Be that dancing skill or music composition skill).
    </p>
    <p>
      Robot Jacket uses gyroscope readings from 3 separate accelerometers, one on each arm and one mounted to the back.
      I take the magnitude of each gyroscope reading using the x, y, and z values from each gyroscope and map each to a 
      different parameter to create a Frequency Modulation Synthesizer. The right arm maps to the carrier frequency, the 
      left arm maps to the modulator frequency, and the one on the back maps to modulation depth.
