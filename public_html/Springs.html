        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is an exercise in coding and simulating masses on springs, to acheive a variety of effects!
            The four included simulations are: Simple mass on spring, chain pendulum, cube of jelly, and hanging cloth.
            Each simulation required a different permutation of mass-spring connections, and all of the affecting
            forces had to be calculated for each mass(sometimes up to dozens) in each frame; this included gravity,
            wind speed, spring tension, the directional forces applied from each connecting mass, and sometimes more.
